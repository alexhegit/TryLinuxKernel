The KMP profiler

It used to export information about memory leaks related with
memory (de)allocated by vmalloc() and vfree() 

Compilation:
	$make
It will built out kmp.ko and kmp-test.ko

Test Enviroment:
	Linux Ubuntu 12.04 3.13.0-32-generic

usage: 
	$insmod kmp.ko
	$echo <saddr> > /sys/kernel/qeexo_kmp/scan_start_addr
	$echo <eaddr> > /sys/kernel/qeexo_kmp/scan_end_addr
	$cat /sys/kernel/qeexo_kmp/memleaks

	The kmp-test.ko is used for test the kmp.ko which will
	allocat memorys by vmalloc.
	$insmoe kmp-test.ko

TODOs:
	show the <instruction pointer>
	*I am not sure what's means it is.
